# General info:
*	D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets standards.
*	The D3.js library uses pre-built functions to select elements, create SVG objects, style them, or add transitions, dynamic effects or tooltips to them. These objects can also be styled using CSS. Large datasets can be bound to SVG objects using D3.js functions to generate text/graphic charts and diagrams.The data can be in various formats such as JSON, comma-separated values (CSV) or geoJSON,.

# Technologies:
*	We used visual studio code.

# Features:
* SVG provides different shapes like lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses etc. Hence, designing visualizations with SVG gives you more flexibility and power in what you can achieve.
* Tooltips: There are two possible methods of creating tooltips in D3. js. The first method is by creating the SVG <title> tags as a descendant of an interactable element. The second approach is to use mouseover , mosueout events to dynamically move and change the visibility of a tooltip.There are two possible methods of creating tooltips in D3. js. 
* Transitions: Transition is the process of changing from one state to another of an item. This method supports most of the selection methods such as â€“ attr(), style(), etc
*	The data is initially plotted by taking Poverty(%) on x-axis and Lacks Healthcare(%) on y-axis.
* Later, Age(Median), Household Income(Median) are also added on x-axis. Tooltips were added to circles and displayed the data based on the user selection.
* The x-axis scale is altered based on user selection and data is displayed on the chart. 

# Setup:
*	There was no specific setup done to work with D3.
*	Visual studio code was used to write the index.html, app.js.
