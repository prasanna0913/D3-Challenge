# General info:
*	D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets standards.
*	The D3.js library uses pre-built functions to select elements, create SVG objects, style them, or add transitions, dynamic effects or tooltips to them. These objects can also be styled using CSS. Large datasets can be bound to SVG objects using D3.js functions to generate text/graphic charts and diagrams.The data can be in various formats such as JSON, comma-separated values (CSV) or geoJSON,.

# Technologies:
*	We used visual studio code.

# Features:
*	SVG objects are used for the graphical presentations.
*	Tooltips are used to make plots more readable.
*	Transitions are used to place the plots in desired way.
*	Data is manipulated using SVG objects, modified using tooltips and adjusted  the plot with transitions in this D3-challenge. 
*	The data is initially plotted by taking Poverty(%) on x-axis and Lacks Healthcare(%) on y-axis.
* Later, Age(Median), Household Income(Median) are also added on x-axis. Tooltips were added to circles and displayed the data based on the user selection.
* The x-axis scale is altered based on user selection and data is displayed on the chart.
